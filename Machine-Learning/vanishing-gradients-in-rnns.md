# Vanishing Gradients in RNNs

### Prerequisite Knowledge
**How do Neural Networks work?**
- Info travels from input neurons to output neurons
- Error is calculated and propogated back through network to update weights

**How do RNNs work?**
- Info travels through time
- Info from previous time points enter the neural network to be used as functions for the following time points
- Calculate cost function at each time point

**What does the cost function do?**
- Compares outcomes to desired outcomes
