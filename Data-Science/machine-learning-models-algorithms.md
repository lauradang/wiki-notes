# Machine Learning Models/Algorithms

There are three types:
### Supervised Learning
eg. Regression, [Decision Tree](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/01/decision-tree-simplified/), [Random Forest](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/06/introduction-random-forest-simplified/), KNN, Logistic Regression

### Unsupervised Learning
eg. Apriori algorithm, K-means

### Reinforcement Learning
eg. Markov Decision Process
