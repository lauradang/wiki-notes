  # Random Forests 
  #### Difficulties with trees 
  - More leaves lead to overfitting 
  - Less leaves lead to inaccurate predictions (cannot capture as many patterns and distinctions) 
  
  #### What is a random forest? 
  - uses many trees 
  - makes prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree 
  - better predictive accuracy than a single decision tree 
  
  ```python 
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
  from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
  
  forest_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)
  forest_model.fit(train_X, train_y)
  melb_preds = forest_model.predict(val_X)
  print(mean_absolute_error(val_y, melb_preds))
  ```
