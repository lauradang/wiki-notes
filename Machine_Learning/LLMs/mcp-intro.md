# Summary: Integrating Cursor with a Local MCP Server for SSE Communication

This guide covers the steps and solutions discussed for integrating a local **MCP server** with **Cursor**, and fixing some common issues with the SSE (`/sse`) and message handling (`/messages`).

## Overview of SSE and MCP Communication

### 1. **MCP Server and SSE**:
Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a protocol where the server pushes updates to the client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. The MCP server uses SSE for real-time communication with clients like Cursor.

### 2. **Endpoints in MCP Communication**:
The MCP server communicates with the client using two key endpoints:

- **`/sse`**: The client initially connects to this endpoint to establish the SSE connection. This is where the server sends events like `endpoint` or other messages during the session.
- **`/messages`**: Once the client receives the `endpoint` event, it sends subsequent messages (like JSON-RPC) to this endpoint.

### **Step-by-Step Communication Flow**:

1. **Client Connects to `/sse`**:
   - The client (Cursor) sends an HTTP request to the serverâ€™s `/sse` endpoint to start the SSE stream.
   - **Request Example**:
     ```
     GET https://yourserver.com/sse
     ```

2. **Server Sends the `endpoint` Event**:
   - Upon establishing the SSE connection, the server responds by sending an `endpoint` event.
   - This event tells the client where future messages should be sent (usually to `/messages`).
   - **SSE Response Example**:
     ```
     event: endpoint
     data: {"url": "/messages/"}
     ```

3. **Client Sends Messages to `/messages`**:
   - Once the client has received the `endpoint` event, it begins sending messages to the `/messages` endpoint, which could include any JSON-RPC or other communication the client needs to process.
   - **Example of a POST Request to `/messages`**:
     ```
     POST https://yourserver.com/messages
     {
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "method": "some_method",
       "params": {},
       "id": 1
     }
     ```

4. **Server Responds via SSE**:
   - After processing the message, the server sends a response or another event (like `message`) to the client via the SSE connection. This might contain data or a result from
