# Introduction

## What is machine learning?

Making predictions based off of patterns

## Fitting/Training a Decision Tree

1. Break data into groups/factors
2. Determine predictions for each group

   **Training model is the data used to do this**

3. To consider more factors, the tree can be deeper \(more splits\)

   **Leaf is the point at bottom of tree where one makes the decision**
