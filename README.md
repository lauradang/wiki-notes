# Introduction
## About me

My name is Laura Dang, and I'm a Statistics and Computational Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo. This is an open space where I can dump all my programming knowledge, whether it be for work, side projects, or just learning in general. Feel free to look around :smiley:.
