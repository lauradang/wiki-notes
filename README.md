## What is this page?

This is an open space where I can dump all my programming knowledge, whether it be for work, side projects, or just learning anything in general. 

Remembering and re-googling certain commands or programming blocks over time gets tiring, so I made this page as a quick reference.

â€ŒFeel free to look around!
