# Notes to Rememeber
### Main() parameters:
- Can have two parameters:
  - **argc** is an integer **parameter** (**ARGUMENT COUNT**)
    - number of **arguments** passed to the program
    - program name is always the first **argument**, so there will be at least one **argument** to a program and the minimum value of **argc** will be one.
  -   **argv** is an array (**ARGUMENT VECTOR**)
      - Stores arguments into array (first element is always the program name)
