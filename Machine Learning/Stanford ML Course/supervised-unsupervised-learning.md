# Supervised/Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning

- "Right answers" given

## Types of Supervised Learning

### Regression Problem

- Predict continuous valued output

  - e.g. can be between 200 and 300 dollars

- **Plotting Data**: Think of line of best fit on graph to predict

  - e.g. House prices (1 feature to predict price - square footage)

    - X-axis: Square footage
    - Y-axis: Price

    - Probably a positive correlation (can be fitted with line, curve, etc.

### Classification Problem

- Discrete value output
- e.g. Breast cancer classification - In relation to tumor size (1 feature)
  - Can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 - malignant, type 1, type 2, etc.

## Unsupervised Learning

- "No correct anwers given"
- Derive structure from data
- No feedback based on prediction results

## Types of Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering Algorithm

- Given a dataset, can you find structure in the set?
- Group together elements related with different variables
  - e.g. lifespan, location

### Non-Clustering Algorithm

- Aka Cocktail Party Problem Algorithm
- Find structure in chaotic environment
  - e.g. Two voices in one audio recording - We can separate them by identifying the different sounds
