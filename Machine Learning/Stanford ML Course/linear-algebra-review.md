# Linear Algebra Review

Here are some useful theorems you'll probably forget.

## Matrix Multiplication Properties

### Not Commutative: $$A\cdot B \neq B\cdot A $$ 

### Identity Matrix: $$A\cdot I=I\cdot A=A$$

### Matrix Inverse: 

If A is an m x m matrix and A has an inverse, then $$A^{-1}A=AA^{-1}=I$$
