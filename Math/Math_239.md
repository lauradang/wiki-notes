# Combinatorics Proof Guide

## Proving Combinatoric Identities

1. Define a set
2. Count the set in 2 different ways:
   1. One way that shows the left side
   2. One way that shows the right side
3. For **summations** of products (e.g. $$\sum\limits_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}^2$$), think of how to split each subset into groups.

## Reminders for Understanding

- Weights represent element in set => coefficients represent number of elements that appear
